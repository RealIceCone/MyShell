# MyShell
### A command line made in python
So it's easy to make commands, I guess ðŸ¤·.

# Install
Just install and open it â€” not that hard ðŸ˜­ðŸ¥€ (Only works on Windows, btw.)

# How to use
Once you open it, you can run commands ðŸ˜±. I know, crazy, right?

version 1.0 is very bad and only has these commands: 
- exit
- dir
- cd
- clear (cls)

### How to make your own commands ðŸ˜±
Hereâ€™s an example of a command:
   
    if com.lower().startswith("wait "):
        try: 
            seconds = float(com[5:])
            print(f"Waiting for {seconds} seconds...")
            time.sleep(seconds)
        except ValueError:
            print("Invalid time value. Usage: wait <seconds>")

That's it â€” You just need an example. Unless you have not learnt python yet. I'm not here to teach you Python lil bro ðŸ˜­ðŸ¥€ðŸ’€.

# Roadmap
- Add more commands
- Command aliases
- Better error handling

  # Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Windows
